# blog
This is a simple self-hosted, lightweight, singe-user PHP blog, where you can create your own Facebook-like feed. Give read access to other people, and you can share rich text with photos including highlighted code or links.

In this context lightweight means:
* No npm dependency, there won't be an annoying 1GB `node_modules` directory.
* No pipeline. What you see is pure code without a need to install it.
* No overhead, essential features, simple usage.

## Live demo
Live demo is available here:

https://blog.m1k1o.net/

Please note, that this demo has very limited computing resources, strict rate limiting and can be reset at anytime. Upload of files will not always work, but as simple demo to see this product in action it is enough.

## Install standalone app using `docker-compose`
You need to install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Step 1: Download and run `docker-compose.yml`.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m1k1o/blog/master/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

You can specify these environment variables, otherwise the default ones will be used:
* **HTTP_PORT=80** - where the blog will be accessible.
* **DATA=./data** - directory to store the user data.

These environment variables can be stored in the `.env` file or passed to the command directly:
```
HTTP_PORT=3001 DATA=/home/user/blog docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 2: Create `data/` directory and download `config.ini` file.
Download default config file and copy to your new `./data/` directory.

```
mkdir data && cd data
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m1k1o/blog/master/config.ini
```

Now you can modify your config.

### Correct permissions
Make sure your `./data/` directory has correct permissions. Apache is running as a `www-data` user, which needs to have write access to the `./data/` directory (for uploading images).

#### Prefered solution
Change the directory owner to the `www-data` user:

```
chown 33:33 ./data/
```

Alternatively, add the `www-data` user to the user group that owns the `./data/` directory.

#### Bad solution (but it works)
Set `777` permission for your `./data/`, so everyone can read, write, and execute:

```
chmod 777 ./data/
```

**NOTICE:** You should not use `777`. You are giving access to anyone for this directory. Maybe to some attacker, who can run his exploit here.

## Build using docker
You need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

If you don't want do spawn a new database server, but you want to use your existing `mariadb` or `mysql` server, you can install this blog using Docker.

### Build image
After you have cloned and accessed the repository, you need to run this command. It will build a docker image with a tag `blog`.
```
docker build --tag blog .
```

### Run container
After you have built the image, you can run it as the following:

```
docker run \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -v ./data:/var/www/html/data \
  blog
```

Now you can copy the config to your new `./data` directory and set up the database connection settings.

```
cp ./config.ini ./data/config.ini
```

## Install
If you have decided that you don't want to use Docker, you can intall it manually.

**Requirements:** Apache 2.0*, PHP 7.4, MariaDB 10.1

**NOTICE:** If you would like to use Nginx or another web server, make sure that the sensitive data are not exposed to the public. Since `.htaccess` is protecting those files in Apache, that could not be the case in a different environment. Take care of:
* **config.ini** - disallow access to all *.ini* files for the public.
* **data/logs/\_ANY_.log** - make sure no sensitive information are located in *.log*.

### Database Schema
You can find database schema in the `./app/db/01_schema.sql` file.

### Debug mode
To check if your server is set up correctly, turn on a debug mode (in config add `debug = true`) to see the details. In the debug mode, an error may be shown if you are missing some **PHP extensions** needed to be installed on your server.

## Config file
**DO NOT** edit `./config.ini` file. If you wish to modify the config, simply make a copy to the `./data/config.ini` directory and edit it there.

**But, why?** If there is any change in config file (most likely adding a new feature), you will have problems with merging a new version. Also, if you would fork this repository, you might accidentally push your secrets to the git. We don't want that to happen. Content of the `/data` directory is ignored by the git, so none of your pictures or personal data should ever be published to git.
